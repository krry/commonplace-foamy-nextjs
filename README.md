# commonplace

My humble [[commonplace]] which:

- is effectively a digital garden
- uses the Zettelkasten method
- started as an archive of markdown writings and a [Roam](https://roamresearch.com) graph
- templated on @yenly's [Foamy NextJS](https://github.com/yenly/foamy-nextjs) starter
- sails the open-source, data-sovereign seas with [Foam](https://foambubble.github.io)
- can also be maintained with obsidian
- is auto-published with Vercel whenever I **_Ship It!_**™
