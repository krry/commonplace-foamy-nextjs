# The Commonplace of Kerrbear

My humble commonplace "book" which:
- is getting superseded by Notion
- I need to figure out how to pump Notion docs into

- is effectively a digital garden
- uses the Zettelkasten method
- started as an archive of markdown writings and a [Roam](https://roamresearch.com) graph
- templated on @yenly's [Foamy NextJS](https://github.com/yenly/foamy-nextjs) starter
- accommodates a nested note index, and dynamically routes via internalinks
- auths with Github for fully search and dir views
- creates a page for hashtags or tags in frontmatter
- sails the open-source, data-sovereign seas with [Foam](https://foambubble.github.io)
- can also be maintained with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md)
- is auto-published with [Netlify](https://netlify.com) whenever I **_Ship It!_**:tm:
- lives at [kerrbear.wtf](https://kerrbear.wtf) for shiggles
