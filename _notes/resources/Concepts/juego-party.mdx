# Juego Party

🎉 ¡Juega para ti! 🤩

I'd love for you to join me on the north lawn of Dolo Park in the middle of the flat.

I'll bring a frisbee and the tarot and whatever else Bagmo has in store.

What would you like to play?
Who has fun stuff?

👩‍🎤 Kazoos highly encouraged 🎶

🚫 Mind the Rules 🤨

2. No work.

👒 Look for Mabel, our totem 👵

😎 COME PLAY! 🤣
