# Guidelines for constructing responsive-ready hero images
## Sizing
- min-width: 2560px
- min-height: 320px
- max-height: 480px
- mobile width: 480px
- desktop width: 1280px
- widescreen width: 2560px
- [hero sizing example](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/23825/hero%20guidelines.png)/[full-size example](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/23825/hero%20guidelines%402x.png)

## Layout
- leave out text or other page elements; these will have to scale with the screen width, so they will move and change quite a bit
- any overlaid text or other page elements must be layout independent on the x-axis; different screen widths cause text and elements to wrap in different ways

## Color
- imagery used must provide good contrast to overlaid text or page elements; anticipate that overlaid text will move
