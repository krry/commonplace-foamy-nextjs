# UX and You

## What is UX?

* It's an absurd acronym for an absurdly broad field.
* Ostensibly derived from "User eXperience", it's now most often used as a normative crutch to describe whether or not a person likes software.
* A UX occurs when a human interacts with a computer.
* So UX as a discipline considers all the factors that influence a human-computer interaction (or HCI).

## Why is UX?

* Simply put, human innovation outpaces the understanding of human innovation.
* UX has arisen as an occupation to bridge the growing gap between people and technology.
* Developers of software and hardware harness applied mathematics to create literal multipliers of human effort.
* As the multipliers become greater and more valuable, they become necessarily more complex and difficult to understand.
* Paradoxically then, as technologies become more capable of improving human lives, they become harder to use and harder to understand.
* I realize that might be a tough pill to swallow, so let me offer an example.

### The Mutual Capacitance Touchscreen

* Tremendous potential - allow people to directly manipulate data with their most dexterous appendages
* Profound complexity - [mutual capacitance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_capacitance) touchscreens took probably thousands and thousands of research and development hours, and [dozens][p1] [of][p2] [patents][p3] [protect][p4] [the][p5] [incredible][p6] [advances][p7] [in][p8] [technology][p9] [it][p10] [took][p11] [to][p12] [deliver][p13] [them][p13] [to][p14] [the][p15] [market][p16].

## Facets of UX

1. Psychology - understanding humans is the primary responsibility of a UXer; the UXer serves the user
2. Technology - understanding technology is the secondary responsibility of a UXer; the UXer strives to make technology serve the user, rather than the other way around
3. Aesthetics - purely functional technology is frightening, sometimes ugly, so it repels many potential users
4. Economics - a UXer must find a sponsor, client, cause, or business that understands the value of experience design

## The Cast

1. User - has wants and needs the business can fulfill
2. Developer - can build anything with proper direction
3. Designer - determines and describes the optimal solution
4. Stakeholder - establishes the goal to be achieved and defines success

## The Process

1. Business goals
2. User research
3. Technology appraisal
4. Flow map
5. Requirements document
6. Interface prototype
7. Visual design
8. Development
9. Testing
10-∞. Iteration
