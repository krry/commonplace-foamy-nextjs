# Fresh MacBook Air M1 Web Dev Setup
## by [@krry](https://github.com/krry/)

This time it's an M1 MacBook Air dipped in gold.

First I start the Xcode command line tools downloading. That gits me `git` among other essentials. Open terminal with spotlight and then:

```sh
xcode-select --install
```

Before we go any further, we change Spotlight's hotkey to ⌥⎵ to let [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com) inhabit ⌘⎵
Before long I'll also want [Flux](https://justgetflux.com/) to ease my eyes and Spectacle to move windows around.
Spectacle for window arrangement is no longer maintained, but they point me to [Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com/), which seems like a worthy successor.

Then I launch Safari to get:

* Chrome or [Chromium](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src.git/+/master/docs/mac_arm64.md)
* [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/?dv=darwinarm64)
* [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/)
* [Notion](https://notion.so)
* [Figma](https://figma.com)
* [Zoom](https://zoom.us)

Some offer a version tuned for Apple Silicon.

In iTerm I mkdir `~/Code` and start keeping this log (`vim ~/Code/fresh-macbook-air-m1-dev-setup.md`) there.

In the App Store app I comb through my Apple ID's previous downloads and grab things like Slack, Aperture, Sketch, Motion. Little Inferno, Limbo, and Kingdom: New Lands peer at me out of the shadows of time spent wistfully wishing for something profound. I wasn't yet a father. How easily things change. (This step could have waited.)

Now I am getting close to operable. I'll need to [generate some new RSA keys](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent#adding-your-ssh-key-to-the-ssh-agent) to auth with Github.

In iTerm2, I install [`brew`](https://brew.sh):

```sh
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```
This set my `$BREW_PREFIX` to `/opt/homebrew/bin' when I had been accustomed to it being `/usr/local`. I have not gleaned the reason or the full impact of this yet. But everything seems to be working. I caught a rumor that it might make it difficult to run the Rust suite via Homebrew.

Once I have `brew` available, I like to enrich my prompt with [Starship](https://starship.rs), which requires a [nerd font](https://nerdfonts.com) or two. Fira Code has great ligatures.

I also will need Fish Shell before long. I trust that Ol' Bash will always be there. And **`zsh`** somehow` hasn't made it out of the 90s yet. So that leaves me with a few options. It starts with `brew install fish` and there is [plenty more on the fish setup here](./fish/fish-setup.md)

Fish needs `fisher` to manage its packages, which can easily come in from Github if we know the author and repo names. E.g.,

```fish
fisher install edc/bass # use bash scripts in fish
\ laughedelic/pisces # for completion of pairs
\ FabioAntunes/fish-nvm # nvm in fish
```

Then I clone my dotfiles and run the `set-defaults.sh` for Mac OS. My key refresh rate and responsiveness soar while the boilerplate dissolves away.

I'll need `node` and `npm` right? Brew already gave me `yarn`. And node rings in at v15.13.0 which is quite recent. But I will want to be able to juggle Nodes and Rubies as they emerge so we'll need…

## Version managers

`brew install nvm` works like a charm to get me a non-system `node`
[Installing `rvm`](https://rvm.io/rvm/install) on the other hand is kind of a pain. We'll need to `brew install gnupg` first and get the maintainers' keys and such.

Halfway through that labyrinth I realized that I had resolved on `rbenv` the last time I tried this. So backing away slowly without turning my back on `rvm`, I found my way back to sanity. `brew install rbenv` and then it walks me through `rbenv init` and such.

It might be faster tho. [Kamadhenu](https://github.com/krry/kamadhenu) comes up real quick.

Next I'll try to get a simple Next.js app running locally. I may decide to offshore such tasks to GitPod, and then all this will have been futile 😜

Bonus!!!
